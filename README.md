# hello-world
A first step MUST be taken project!
This is also my very first time do the coding stuff. Below is what the syntax examples I found

Phrase Emphasis
> *italic*   **bold**
> _italic_   __bold__

Links
Inline:
> An [example](http://url.com/"EXAMPLE")

Reference-style labels (totles are optional):
> An [example][id]. Then, anywhere else in the doc, define the link:

    [id]: http://example.com/  "Title: EXAMPLE"
    
Images
Inline
> ![THIS IS AN IMAGE](/path/img.jpg "Title")

Reference-Style:
>![THIS IS AN IMAGE][id]

    [id]: /url/to/img.jpg "Title"
